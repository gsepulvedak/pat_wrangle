Various processes, such as patterning the polysilicon, planarizing top layers of the structure, and the like can remove top portions of the dielectric layer, which can result in decreased control of gate height when a metal gate is formed in place of the dummy gate electrode, decreased control of fin height for finFETs, and the like. Increasing the resistance of the dielectric layer to attack from these processes, such as by implanting silicon or the like into the dielectric layer before such other processes are performed, results in less removal of the top surface, and hence improved control of the resulting structure dimensions and performance."
